# Registrar Registry

This arrangement works much like a car dealership. A customer who is interested in buying a car visits the showroom and 
is shown the available cars by a knowledgeable sales associate. If the customer chooses to buy a car (not one already in stock, 
for this example), the dealership must then order the car from a manufacturer. The customer ultimately picks up the car and receives 
customer service from the dealership.

A registrar is like a dealership for domain names, and the registry is like the manufacturer. The registrar facilitates the 
transactions and provides support services, while the registry is in charge of producing and delivering the goods. It should be noted 
that a key difference between registering a domain and buying a car is that cars can be owned by consumers, domain names can technically 
only be leased.
